Information: I decided to study different techniques of procedural map generation from this webpage https://christianjmills.com/posts/procedural-map-generation-techniques-notes/ All of these methods are hand written,
with help from ChatGPT for code cleanup, and likely assistance on documentation.

Using: Feel free to use this code for ideas, or implementation. All of this is rather barebones, but I figured would be a great help knowing different methods of generation. I would love to exeriment later with combining these techniques, which
you will hopefully see done in the future, for example taking Voronoi diagrams for biome generation, then using a diffusion limited aggregation method to fill in these biomes with the oppropiate data type.
